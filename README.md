  for asynchronous.

- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Collection
  of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - A single-activity architecture, using
      the [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to manage composable
      transactions.

    - [Truth](https://truth.dev/) - A library for performing assertions in tests

## Modularization Structure

- I used convention plugin for manage dependencies.
- This app modularization guide is soon.
- When I implement navigation for multiModule, I got help this
  article. [Android Multimodule Navigation with the Navigation Component](https://medium.com/itnext/android-multimodule-navigation-with-the-navigation-component-99f265de24)

## API Key üîë

- You will need to provide developer key to fetch the data from TMDB API.
- Generate a new key (v3 auth) from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). Copy the key
  and go back to Android project.
- Open the page is gradle/local.properties
- Define a constant API_KEY, it looks like

``` API_KEY = PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY ```

## Upcoming Features
- CI Support
- UI and Unit Tests
